	<h1>Some information on Time, Space and their complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity in JavaScript refers to how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of its input, typically denoted as 'n'.
 It is measured using Big O notation, which describes the upper bound of an algorithm's performance in the worst-case scenario.
 This helps developers understand how efficiently code will perform as input size grows</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> in JavaScript refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution, primarily determined by the size of the input and the data structures created.
 It is typically expressed using Big O notation to describe the worst-case scenario for memory usage.</p>
